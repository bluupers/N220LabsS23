//This is an application that will start a div at a black color, and as a user presses buttons associated with RGB, the div will change to new colors. The button presses should affect additively - that is. If a div is currently blue, pressing +red buttons will change the div to a purple color.

//9 buttons (associated with red green and blue). There should be a +1, +5, and +10 button for each color.

//1 div that will change colors to the rgb color calculated

//1 div that shows the current calculated rgb color
