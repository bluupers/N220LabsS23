/*UI Navigation Highlighter

Make an application with six divs on the screen, each with a different word.

When any of the divs is clicked,

highlight that that div by changing its background color and making the text bold
remove the bold/background highlight from any other divs
add the clicked div's text into a seperate div at the top of the screen*/

//ALGORITHM START

//declare variable to easily manipulate HTML attributes

//create function that changes background color, and bolds text by accessing styles of the specified div
//remove other bold/highlights within this same function, perhaps an if statement?
//change the inner html of the top div to the same as the clicked div
