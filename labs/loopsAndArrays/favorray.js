// Create a string array. List at least five of your favorite things in that array.

// Then, write a loop that writes to a div element each of them, with the string ", is one of my favorite things." after the thing. For instance, one line in the div might say, "Pizza, is one of my favorite things."

//create an array with the following things
//my stinky gorlfriend, Kellyn
//lofi beats to study/relax to
//Persona 5
//McDonald's Sweet Tea
//Hawks from My Hero Academia

//create a for loop
//let initialization be variable "i" equalling 0
//let test be variable "i" is less than the array's length property (plus one?)
//let update be variable "i" plus one

//within for loop declare item at index to be equal to the array name at "i"
//within for loop edit inner HTML of a div element to be:
//item at index variable name plus string ", is one of my favorite things."
