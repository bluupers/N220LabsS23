/* Write a loop that runs 25 times and writes the iterand (current iteration of the loop) out onto the page inside of a div element.

However,

When the iterand is divisible by 3, write the word "beep" instead
When the iterand is divisible by 5, write the word "bop" instead
When the iterand is divisible by 3 AND 5, write "beepbop" instead */

//unsure of how to go about this one, wrote algorithm for other three programs
