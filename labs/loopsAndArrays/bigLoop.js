//Write a loop that displays in a div the numbers 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000. There should only be one line of code inside of your loop.

//create an array with the numbers 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000

//create a for loop
//let initialization be variable "i" equalling 0
//let test be variable "i" is less than the array's length property plus one
//let update be variable "i" (plus one?)
//inside of the loop change the inner HTML of a div identified by ID to i 


//this loop should run 5 times, displaying 1000, then 2000, then 3000, then 4000, then 5000 within the specified div
