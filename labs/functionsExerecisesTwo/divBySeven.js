//Create an application that with an input and a button. When the user clicks on the button, update a div on the page to tell the user if what the user typed into the input is divisible by 7 or not. Use a separate function from the onclick function to discern if it is divisible. This function should return either true if it is divisible  or false if it is not.


//create a function to check if input is divisible by seven
    //divide input by 7 and see if the remainder is equal to zero
    //if it is then return "true"
        //else return "false"
